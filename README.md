The mseed_to_sac.py, event_noise_cut.py, 1_generate_detect_data_3cRand_arrayjob_v2.py, 2_generate_event_array3c4d_arrayjob.py are used for the seismic data processing and intergration.
The 3_detect_3c_DDP_v3.py is the improved training code working on distributed GPUs on clusters for earthquake detection.
The 4_predict_location3c4d_DPP.py is the improved training code working on distributed GPUs on clusters for earthquake localization.
